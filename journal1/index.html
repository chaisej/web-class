            <h3>In a world where the internet has become an integral part of our lives, the concept of a website takes on many meanings. J.R. Carpenter, Laurel Schwulst, and Ursula K. Le Guin each offer unique perspectives on the essence of websites, their purpose, and their potential future. Through this journal entry, I try to pull apart the ties of human creativity and the ever-evolving technology of websites.

            <h2>"A Handmade Web" by J.R. Carpenter</h2>
            <h4>A website as a handmade creation, akin to a work of art. The nostalgia of the early internet--where websites were crafted with care and intention, reflecting the personality and vision of their creators--was an exciting dawn. The web was a frontier of personal expression and exploration. Websites were not merely digital destinations but portals into the minds and hearts of their creators, a sentiment that I fear has been diluted in our current era of templates and homogenized designs.</h4>

            <h2>"My Website is a Shifting House" by Laurel Schwulst</h2>
            <h4>Websites as dynamic, ever-evolving spaces. Websites are homes that can be rearranged and transformed at will. Websites do not need to be static or clinical. They can and must evolve with us, adapting to our changing interests, experiences, and identities. A website is a living, breathing entity that can grow and change alongside us.</h4>

            <h2>"A Rant on Technology" by Ursula K. Le Guin</h2>
            <h4>There is an unchecked pursuit of innovation for its own sake. I think we must consider the deeper implications of our creations. We must ask ourselves why we put things on the internetâ€”is it for genuine connection and expression, or are we merely swept up in the tide of technological progress?</h4>

            <h3>In conclusion, the essence of a website is deeply intertwined with human creativity and the evolving digital landscape. Websites are not just digital artifacts; they are dynamic expressions of our identities and ideas. While their future may be uncertain, their appeal as mediums--whether customizable tumblr pages or telehealth platforms or resturaunt review reporter--for connection and expression suggests that websites will remain. It is up to us, as creators and consumers of the web, to ensure that the spirit of the handmade web endures.</h3>
