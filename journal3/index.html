            <div class="question1">
                How have the web design skills we've covered helped further your growth as a creative person?
            </div>

            <div class="answer1">
                I think the class has taught me a lot about form and playing around with the basics. For example, I think learning to use color can drastically improve the design and message of your site. I think the various projects from our book show and tells to our storytelling project, I think I’ve stayed static in what I want to create about, BUT I think my process is much more different and more streamlined. At the beginning, I was worried about color and fonts and the little details. Now, I try to build with the bones, then the muscles, then the flesh. As someone looking to go into a field where I won’t necessarily be coding but interacting with developers, knowing the basics of web design will be very helpful!

            <div class="question2">
                Are you satisfied with the work you produced?
            </div>

            <div class="answer2">
                Yes! I am most happy about my final project. It’s hard to think a site is finished if it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the websites you are accustomed to. The hardest part of coding for me is responsiveness. This has been my struggle since it was first introduced in class. I think I have gotten better at making my sites responsive, only by using a transferable unit of measurement: viewport. But I think I could try much more to learn the ins and outs of a responsive website. I am very happy with my final project because of how streamlined it is. It is a relatively simple concept, but I think the clean design makes it feel like a real website. I also got better at using classes and ids during the final project.

            <div class="question3">
                Has the class changed your views on art, technology or visual culture?
            </div>
            
            <div class="answer3">
                This class has given me a great appreciation for all the developers out there. AND for all the people who customize their tumblr sites. This is very tedious work. I think I have a deeper understanding of how intricate the network of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is when creating a website. Especially one that pulls much more information than the ones we created in class. Website design is an art form and I think you have to really work your creative muscles to make each interface different and intuitive.

            <div class="question4">
                Do you plan on using your skills in the future? 
            </div>

            <div class="answer4">
                Yes! I would love to work on expanding my final project. Literary magazine websites are some of my favorite, but they are not very experimental when it comes to interface. I feel like there could be a lot of convergence between visual art of a website and writing art. I will definitely use the skills in this class in the future. I have taken coding classes in the past, but this one really connected to dots of how to show your work—in the sense that in my previous classes, we were not linking pages or uploading our sites into a functional server. <br> Again, I think this knowledge will come in handy with my UX career!

            <div class="question5">
                Any closing remarks for the rest of the class?
            </div>

            <div class="answer5">
                This was a (frustrating) worthwhile experience!! Learning to code was not scary but just very tedious. I feel like I need flashcards to remember the different properties CSS can control. I know this comes with the territory. Overall, I had a great time in this class and look forward to designing more websites in the future.
