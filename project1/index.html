                It starts with the great red rift across the heart of the world's sole continent, spewing ash that blots out the sun. It starts with death, with a murdered son and a missing daughter. It starts with betrayal, and long dormant wounds rising up to fester. This is the Stillness, a land long familiar with catastrophe, where the power of the earth is wielded as a weapon. And where there is no mercy.

            <section class="abouttext">
                <p>Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.</p>
            
                <p>Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.</p>

            <section class="chaisetext"><p>The Fifth Season captivated me from start to finish. While one begins their reading journey confused and may end it so (at least at the end of the first novel), the language is sweeping and emotional. Jemisin's stab at second person point of view is compelling and offers an intimate interior--which I never imagined could be achieved through the style before. The twists and turns of the world were exciting. Essun, the character we sit in the head of for most of the people, offers a morally grey interior. She makes mistakes and refuses to acknoledge them, in a headstrong way that illuminates a truth to human nature. Jemisin's understanding of the human condition--even in a science fiction, futuristic setting--exposes a soft underbelly. I laughed, cried, gasped, EXPERIENCED it all.</p>
            
            <p>The mother-child relationships, between Essun and Nassun, between all the characters and the earth, are compelling. While one might argue this is simply a well-done science fiction novel, but Jemisin discovers much more about abuse of love and power. The different point of views (Damaya, Syenite, and Essun) highlight the different stages of girlhood. There is some romance, but the read is worthwhile because of each narrator's understanding of the systems of power. The abuse and exploitation of a magical race is an exciting element of the novel. Jemisin engages with the topic, not from a fantasy mindset... Fantasy is just the backdrop. She approaches the world from a sociological view. The relations between different races of people informs the actions of our narrators. The Fifth Season is truly a masterclass in science fiction fantasy!</p></section>

            <section class="seriessubtitle">Follow Essun on her journey to save the world and her daughter in the next installments. My favorite is the second book in the series, <i>The Obelisk Gate</i>. It's when you begin to understand the world on a new level and our main characters make new friends and new enemies.</section>
