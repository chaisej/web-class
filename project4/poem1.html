                why I chose this poem

            <div class="poemexplanation">
                I adore this poem for its simplicity of language and syntax. The imagery of the lake is striking. The last image is beautiful and painful and a bit numbing. The author's audio narration is one of my favorites. She captures a dull sadness that is palpable.
