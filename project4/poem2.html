                    So I was driving <br>
                    with my old man. The day wasted <br>
                    save for the cobalt haze <br>
                    closing around us. <br>
                    We were on our way to kill <br>
                    our dog, Susan. I mean, we had to <br>
                    bring her to the clinic <br>
                    to put her down, this <br>
                    murder or maybe <br>
                    they meant put her in <br>
                    the ground—though I knew Susan <br>
                    would be ashed in<br>
                    the incinerator <br>
                    out back. Puffs <br>
                    of smoke, little ghost <br>
                    poodles. Where was I going <br>
                    with this? Right—the car, <br>
                    the rain, the legend of joy <br>
                    & pain. My old man <br>
                    & I, the Ford big enough <br>
                    for us to never <br>
                    touch. & maybe I meant to<br>
                    make the hairpin turn <br>
                    too hard. & the thing flipped<br>
                    like a new law, going 80. Maybe <br>
                    I wanted, at last, to feel him <br>
                    against me—&<br>
                    it worked. As the colors spun <br>
                    through the windshield, wild <br>
                    metal clanking <br>
                    our shoulders, the sudden <br>
                    wetness warm <br>
                    everywhere, he slammed into me & <br>
                    we hugged for the first time <br>
                    in decades. It was perfect &<br>
                    wrong, like money <br>
                    on fire. The skin <br>
                    around his neck so soft, his<br>
                    aftershave somehow <br>
                    summer. It lasted <br>
                    not a second but <br>
                    he was smiling, his teeth already <br>
                    half-gone, as if someone <br>
                    wiped them away to make room <br>
                    for something truer. Put it <br>
                    down on the page, son, he said <br>
                    one night, after telling me <br>
                    why he did what he did <br>
                    with his life, shitfaced <br>
                    on Hennessy. We were sitting <br>
                    at the kitchen table before his shift <br>
                    at the sock factory. His eyes: raindrops <br>
                    in a nightmare. I touched him, <br>
                    then let go. The car stopped <br>
                    rolling, we hung upside down <br>
                    as things dripped. Steam <br>
                    or breath. I did <br>
                    what any boy would do <br>
                    after getting exactly <br>
                    what he wanted: I kissed <br>
                    my father. He grinned <br>
                    I think. His pupils <br>
                    elsewhere. I reached back, unlatched <br>
                    the cage. The dog <br>
                    stepped out, sniffed <br>
                    my old man, still warm, then ran <br>
                    into the trees, into her second <br>
                    future. I walked from the wreck <br>
                    till the yards became <br>
                    years, the dirt road <br>
                    a city, until my face <br>
                    became this face & the rain <br>
                    washed the gasoline clean <br>
                    from my fingers. I found <br>
                    a payphone in the heart <br>
                    of the poem & called you <br>
                    collect to say all this <br>
                    knowing it won’t make <br>
                    a difference, only <br>
                    more. So hello, hi, the blood <br>
                    inside my hands <br>
                    is now inside <br>
                    the world. <br>
                    Words, the prophets <br>
                    tell us, destroy <br>
                    nothing they can’t <br>
                    rebuild. I did it to hold <br>
                    my father, to free <br>
                    my dog. It’s an old story, Mother,<br> 
                    anyone can tell it.

                why I chose this poem
            </div>
            
            <div class="poemexplanation">
                I love Ocean Vuong's collection "Night Sky with Exit Wounds," which led me to read "Time is a Mother," his more recent poetry collection. This poem stuck out to me most. The imagery is vivid, the emotionality is potent. I love dogs, so any mention in a poem gets stars from me. This is a beautiful piece about estrangement and desire to be known again. It's so refreshing. I love it!
