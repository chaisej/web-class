                why I chose this poem
            </div>
            
            <div class="poemexplanation">
                This is a new poem of mine. I think I often write about sad things or sad endings. This poem is definitely meant to be lighter. I feel like we hold the mistakes so close, as if they've become a part of us... We then punish ourselves for worrying about the mistakes. It's an endless give and take. I wanted to tackle missing even the embarassing parts of life in death. The important milestones are great, but what's more human to me is the mistakes. "Seconds" in the last stanza refers to seconds to time-craving more time even though life was hard-and second servings-even though the "bellyache" persisted it was worth it. Life is!!
