                why I chose this poem
            </div>
            
            <div class="poemexplanation">
                This was my favorite poem last year!! Something about it captures an experience, I have not had (thankfully), that feels like it belongs to me. I love "opera glove" and "down of Doom's cheek." Her word choice is incredible and I love the narrative path the poem takes. I want to write a poem like this one day. There is also such a sharp humor to the whole piece without removing the intensity of the drive.
